## Machine Learning

#### Supervised Learning
<pre>
Input - Output Mapping (x,y)
- Regressions: Plot fitting Polynomial / linear (Infinite predictions4)
- Classification : Ex. Breast cancer detection (0/1)
</pre>

#### Unsupervised Learning
<pre>
Unlabeled data (only input, no output provides to computers)
: We do not tell if that data means anything, Let it learn by itself
- Clustering : Grouping data Ex. Google news
- Anomaly detection : Find unusual data points
- Dimentionality reduction : Comparess data using fewer numbers
</pre>
